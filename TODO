- Implement a GUI that works with the iPhone's smaller screen resolution 


- Lay out overlapping images smarter on the map. Suggested solution:
1) compute a distance matrix between all loan items
2) do hierarchical clustering
3) collapse clusters below cutoff X 
4) lay them out around a circle. Circle's radius should depend on the zooming state of the map.

This can get a bit tricky because the clustering should really be done again after every scrolling event, and the distance matrix should be incrementally updated with more / less items without a full recompute.
