- Implement a GUI that works with the iPhone's smaller screen resolution (currently works only on the iPad)

- Lay out overlapping images smarter on the map. Suggested solution is outlined below.
After each map scrolling event / loan feed update:
1) compute a distance matrix between all loan items.
2) cluster the distance matrix.
3) collapse clusters below cutoff X  (cutoff depends on map scrolling state).
4) lay them out around the midpoint of the cluster (medoid?), for example in a circle. Circle's radius should depend on the zooming state of the map.
